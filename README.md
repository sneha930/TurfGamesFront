1. Modal Component :
The modal is a reusable component that displays an overlay (a dark background covering the page) and a box with the form inside.

It also listens for clicks on a close button or outside the modal box to close the modal by calling onClose (which sets modal to null).

Example modal structure:

function Modal({ children, onClose }) {
  return (
    <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={onClose}>
      <div className="modal-content" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
        <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
The outer div (modal-overlay) covers the entire page and darkens the background.
The inner div (modal-content) contains the form.
e.stopPropagation() prevents clicks inside the modal box from closing the modal.
The close button lets the user close the modal.

2. Active Link Styling:
You can highlight the active link (current page) using NavLink from react-router-dom instead of Link. This makes it easier for users to know where they are:

What is NavLink?
NavLink is a special version of React Router‚Äôs Link component.
It automatically applies an active state to the link when the current URL matches the link‚Äôs path.
This lets you style the active link differently (e.g., highlight the current page in the navbar).

3. ‚úÖ What is useNavigate()?
useNavigate is a React Router hook that lets you programmatically navigate to a different route (i.e., change pages in your app) after an action happens, like a login or form submission.

It's similar to how a user clicks a <Link> or <NavLink>, but used in JavaScript logic, not in JSX.

‚úÖ In your code:
const navigate = useNavigate();
This line gives you access to the navigate function.

Then, inside your handleSubmit, you're doing this:

if (role === "ADMIN") {
  navigate("/admin/dashboard");   // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Send admin to admin dashboard
} else if (role === "PLAYER") {
  navigate("/player/dashboard");  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Send player to player dashboard
} else {
  navigate("/");                  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Default fallback
}
This changes the URL without refreshing the page, just like how a <Link> works ‚Äî but dynamically, based on the role you got from the login response.

‚úÖ Why not use <Link> here?
Because <Link> is for static navigation in UI, like buttons or navbars.

But when you log in, you don‚Äôt want the user to click something. You want to redirect them automatically after verifying their credentials.

‚úÖ Simple analogy:
// üëá <Link> is like a button you press
<Link to="/dashboard">Go to dashboard</Link>

// üëá navigate(...) is like pushing the user through the door automatically
navigate("/dashboard");

4. üîí Purpose of ProtectedRoute
It's a wrapper that only allows certain users (based on their role) to access specific routes.

If:
the user is not logged in, redirect them to SignIn.
the user is logged in but has the wrong role, redirect them to Home.
the user has the right role, show the protected content.

code:
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, allowedRole }) => {}
You're creating a wrapper component that accepts:
children: the actual component/page to show (like <AdminDashboard />)
allowedRole: role allowed to access this route (e.g., "ADMIN" or "PLAYER")

const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
This retrieves the currently logged-in user from localStorage. You saved it during login like this:

const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
This retrieves the currently logged-in user from localStorage. You saved it during login like this:
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify({ emailId, role }));

if (!user) return <Navigate to="/signin" />;
If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the SignIn page. üîë

if (user.role !== allowedRole) return <Navigate to="/" />;
If the user is logged in, but their role doesn't match the role required (e.g., a PLAYER tries to access an admin route), redirect them to the Home page. üö´

return children;
‚úÖ If the user is logged in and has the right role, show the protected component/page (children).

üîç Inside ProtectedRoute:
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, allowedRole }) => {
React automatically gives you:
allowedRole from the prop you set.
children is whatever JSX is inside the component ‚Äî in this case, <AdminDashboard />
